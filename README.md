How to use app

PHASE 1

Need to login to app
ONLINE/OFFLINE select status
Tab - Select restaraunts (1 or more). There will be a checklist of restaraunts
If you cllick on Dominos, default waiting time is 30 mins/1 hour.
Can leave comments - what type of promotion, est. order value, etc
You hit enter
All options of people come with their names within your time slot. Also the fact that you’re ordering from Dominos is updated on other’s devices
If nobody wants to order except you, message: “Nobody wants to order at the moment”. Will keep searching though. I think every 1 min it will keep updating
Notification will be sent to everybody who wants to order from Dominos if o. Of people interested >= 2
Name of the other person will appear

PHASE 2 IDEAS
Abiltity to show interest, matching with other users
